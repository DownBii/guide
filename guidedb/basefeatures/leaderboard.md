# Leaderboards

Leaderboards are very common in competive gaming, so of course we have them.

## Types

There are two leaderboards we host:

- Daily streaks | Every set a player plays is a +1 to their streak, in other words just a basic streak system.

- General leaderboards | Works just like a normal ranked leaderboard and it sorts by both rank and XP level.

## Usage

To view the general leaderboard type `!leaderboard` in any channel.

And to view the daily streak leaderboard type `!leaderboard ds` into any channel.
